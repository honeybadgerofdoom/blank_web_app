# Sprint 1 - T02 - INsert team name

## Goal

### Shorter trips to more places!
### Sprint Leader: Brent Blanton

## Definition of Done

* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0</version>` for your final build for deployment.
* Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.
* Increment `server-3.0.jar` deployed for testing and demonstration on SPRINT3 assignment.
* Sprint Review, Restrospective, and Metrics completed (team/sprint3.md).


## Policies

#### Mobile First Design!
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop (in that order).
* Use ReactStrap for a consistent interface (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).
* Must adhere to the TripCo Interchange Protocol (TIP) for interoperability and testing.
#### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code Coverage above 40%
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits include a task/issue number.
* All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.
#### Continuous Integration / Delivery 
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 


## Plan

This sprint will complete the following Epics.

* #123 API Validation:  
To ensure interoperability:
servers should validate all Restful API requests they receive. If the request is not valid, the server should respond with the offending request and an HTTP status code of 400 to signify there was an error in the request sent to the server.
clients should validate all Restful API responses they receive. If the response is not valid, the client should notify the user.
use JSON schemas for the validation.*

* #106 TIP V3:
The server must support the TIP version 3 specification.  This included updating TIPConfig place attributes to hold seven objects.  The TIPLocations object was added to the server side that interacts directly with a database.*

* #70 Short Trip:
Rearrange the trip to make it shorter for less travel time. (nearest-neighbor)*

* #107 Save Trip:
Save the trip to a file in different formats for different purposes.
TIP JSON to load into compatible tools.
CSV to load into a spreadsheet.*

* #109 Modify Trip:
User: Let me modify my trip as I change my mind about my travels. I should be able to:
Add new destinations by entering them.
Select new destinations from data source(s) like a database.
Remove existing destinations.
Rearrange the order of the locations.
Reverse the order of the locations.
Choose a new starting location.*

## Review (focus on solution and technology)

In this sprint, the team performed better than previous sprints. There were a couple of challenges the team had to face but were able to resolve the issues quickly. Having Travis and Code Climate was beneficial for finding code coverage and errors.

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 

These Epics were completed.

* #70 Short Trip:
* #106 Tip V3:
* #107 Save trip:
* #109 Modify Trip:
* #123 API Validation:  

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 

These Epics were not completed.

* None.  All epics were completed.

#### What went well

The team started earlier than previous sprints. Also by staying on top of approving and merging pull requests, the team was able to get completed tasks into master sooner.


#### Problems encountered and resolutions

The team had a couple of problems that slowed production. The main issue was problems with speed on short trip. This was a major delay because of the time that had to be put into re-doing the algorithm for short trip. Testing the javascript code was difficult for the team and took extra time that it shouldn't have. Having to wait for the provided schemas to be updated halted production in the areas that related to them.


## Retrospective (focus on people, process, tools)

In this sprint, the team worked together to complete the five epics assigned.  This was accomplished by effectively communicating through slack, as well as meeting outside of class. The team was able to successfully merge all pull requests.  Any issues that the team encountered were resolved effectively and immediately. 

#### What we changed this sprint

Our changes for this sprint included starting the task sooner. On top of that, we focused on recording daily scrums.

#### What we did well

Communication has always been a strong point of this team. We continue to be able to communicate effectively with each other. We also lended help more freely to those in need which largely contributed to finishing the epics in a more timely manner than last sprint. 

#### What we need to work on

We still need to work on doing more during the early days of the sprint. This sprint we started earlier but we still were very relaxed with how much work we were getting done which delayed progress in the beginning.

#### What we will change next sprint 

We will change how early we start as well as how much we do when we start. Weekly deadlines instead of sprint deadlines.
