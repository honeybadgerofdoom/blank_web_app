### Match Invitations 
#### Description
As a user, I can send an invite for other registered users to join and play a match.

#### Conversation
A player can find an opponent to invite to a game by means of searching or viewing a table of registered users. The player will then be able to send an invitation to their selected opponent and the invitee will then be prompted to either accept or decline the invitation. The inviter will then be notified of the invitee’s answer. When an invitation is accepted, a match will be created between the two players.

### Viewing User Profiles
#### Description
As a user, I can view my own profile or those of the other registered users. 

#### Conversation
A player will be able to view profiles by searching for a specific user or by choosing a player from a list of registered users. Once a user’s profile is selected, their game statistics and profile information will be displayed.
