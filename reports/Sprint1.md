# Sprint 1 - T02 - Team Reakt

## Goal


### Sprint Leader: Matt Young

## Definition of Done
* The design document (design.md) is updated.
* The sprint document (sprint.md) is updated with scrums, completed metrics, review, and retrospective.


## Policies


#### Clean Code


#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code Coverage above 40%.

#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in main to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits include a task/issue number.
* All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.

#### Continuous Integration / Delivery 
* Main is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for main branch.
