# Sprint 1 - T02 - Team Reakt

## Review 
For P1, we set a goal of planning out the structure, design, and development process for our XGame project. To do this, we created and worked on a few simple epics that encapsulate the tasks needed to give ourselves a good base going forward. Much of our time was spent planning new epics and tasks for the coming sprints, as well as creating design documents for our code, so completing many epics was not the focus this time.

### Epics completed
<strong>Set up single-page web app:</strong> A large part of this first checkpoint was spent writing and cleaning up the basic web app source code. We copied over the base structure from our 314 Trip Planner project, then modified it to meet the needs for our XGame. This included removing unnecessary files, client components, and tests. This epic was complete when running the application rendered a blank web page.

<Strong>Navigation and tabs:</Strong> To allow the user to navigate our platform, we added basic tabs that link to blank page templates. In later sprints, we will fill in these components with pages for registration, login, playing matches, user profile, rules, etc.

### Epics not completed
<strong>Team about page:</strong> Since our focus changed to planning over implementation, we did not get to completing this. Eventually, we would like to use this page to show our development team and some information about us to the user.

<strong>Frontend user registration:</strong> For this epic, we planned on creating a registration form and login page for the user to create an account and authenticate themselves. There would also be buttons for logging out and deleting an account. This will be moved to a later sprint.

## Retrospective

### Things that went well
We started planning early, which gave us ample time to complete all of the planning tasks. We communicated regularly and effectively both on Teams and in person. We always approached new challenges with energy and enthusiasm. We made sure to ask questions to the product owner on requirements that were not clear.

### Things that we need to improve
In future sprints, we need to make sure everyone finishes their individual tasks on time, and stays up to speed with agreed upon deadlines. We will have to make more detailed and descriptive tasks after gaining a better understanding of our desired project structure.

### One thing we will change next time
In the future we will double check the assignment specifications so that we do not waste time working on parts that are not as important to meeting our goals.
