## Policies


#### Clean Code


#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code Coverage above 40%.

#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in main to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits include a task/issue number.
* All commits include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.

#### Continuous Integration / Delivery
