# Sprint 4 - T02 - Team Reakt

## Review 

### Epics completed
<strong>Searching for Users:</strong> In this epic we wrote an API to search the database for all users, or for all users matching a search string. We then used this API on the client for the profile page and match invitations.


<strong>Match Invitations:</strong> This epic involved providing users with the ability to invite other registered players to play a match. We created server APIs to update the database with new invitations and games, and hooked up the client components to send requests when necessary. A modal was created to be able to filter and select users through checkboxes, and the players receiving the invites are then able to accept or deny the request.


<strong>Viewing User Profiles:</strong> In this epic we built out a user’s profile page. This included a section to view and update the user’s email address and bio, a section to view their stats, and a section to search for/view other users. The wins and losses are shown for the logged in user and any other user you search for.


<strong>User Experience:</strong> This epic contained many small changes to our webpage.  We created a rules page using cards.  We also added scalable images for each chess piece both on the rules section and on the chess board as a visual enhancement.  We created an about page, also using cards, that gives descriptions of each team member. Polling was added to the Play page to get back the latest Board and Game state from the database after a short interval. 


## Retrospective

### Things that went well
As a team, the things we felt went well during these sprints were our communication, delegation of tasks, and the progress we made on the entire project. We all felt as though we had enough to work on at a given time and our division of labor in our sub-groups made us more productive.  


### Things that we need to improve
As a team, in the upcoming sprints we will improve our Code Climate, our completion of tasks in a timely manner, performance of regular housekeeping tasks for our repo, and our implementation to focus on the design patterns discussed in class. Our Code Climate began to drop significantly, so in the future we will regularly refactor  to improve code quality and remove duplication. When working on a particular task for a prolonged amount of time, we will seek assistance or ask a teammate to take on the task.

### One thing we will change next time
We will evaluate and either merge or close pull requests in a timely manner and delete the branch once it has been merged.
