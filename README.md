# t02: Team ReaKt

## Scrum Ceremonies
Scrum ceremonies include sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective.

Our **Scrum Master** will vary across sprints, with each member getting a turn by the end. Matt will be first.

### Daily Scrum
We have decided to meet three times per week. Our current schedule is:

| Monday  | Wednesday | Saturday |
| ------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1:00 pm | 1:00 pm   | 1:00 pm  |

In these meetings, we will take at most 15 minutes to discuss:
* What did you do since the last daily scrum?
* What will you do until the next daily scrum?
* Are there any impediments in the way?

During sprint planning, the Product Owner should be consulted to construct the Product Backlog. Occasionally, daily scrums may warrant an appearance of the PO if there is confusion or a concept to discuss.
