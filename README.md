# t02: Team ReaKt

## Keys to Success
We believe that a successful Software Development project:
1. Starts with a solid plan.
2. Meets the Product Ownerâ€™s specifications.
3. Gets completed in the required time.
4. Is written with clean code standards.
5. Utilizes continuous integration.

**Metrics associated with success:** testing coverage, days worked, Code Climate maintainability statistics, and timeframe analysis.

## Factors in Project Development

**Biggest challenges:** Asking for help in a timely manner, addressing team issues early on, bringing together a wide variety of ideas, agreeing on coding standards, divvying up work appropriately, and planning.

**How we overcome them:** We will use clear, honest, and frequent communication; plan sprints thoroughly from the start; and attempt to anticipate and prevent problems that may arise.

**Critical elements to success:** Communication, short daily scrums, regression testing, and practicing clean coding standards.

**Critical elements to failure/ challenges:** Lack of communication, lack of planning, tension without working things out as a team, and not starting early enough.

## Scrum Ceremonies
Scrum ceremonies include sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective.

Our **Scrum Master** will vary across sprints, with each member getting a turn by the end. Matt will be first.

### Daily Scrum
We have decided to meet three times per week. Our current schedule is:

| Monday  | Wednesday | Saturday |
| ------- | --------- | -------- |
| 1:00 pm | 1:00 pm   | 1:00 pm  |

In these meetings, we will take at most 15 minutes to discuss:
* What did you do since the last daily scrum?
* What will you do until the next daily scrum?
* Are there any impediments in the way?

During sprint planning, the Product Owner should be consulted to construct the Product Backlog. Occasionally, daily scrums may warrant an appearance of the PO if there is confusion or a concept to discuss.

## Sprints
**Total sprints:** 7

**Sprint duration:** 2 weeks
